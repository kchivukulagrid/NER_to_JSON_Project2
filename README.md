---

## ⚡ Run On Another Computer (Quick Start)

Use these exact commands on a fresh machine.

### 1. Clone and enter project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kchivukulagrid/NER_to_JSON_Project2.git
cd NER_to_JSON_Project2
```

### 2. Create environment and install dependencies
```bash
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```

If `outlines_core` fails to build (usually on Python `3.13+`/`3.14`), use Python `3.11` for this project.  
Alternative (if you must keep Python `3.14`): install Rust first, then reinstall deps.

`llama.cpp` is only required for Task 5 quantization and GGUF benchmarking. Tasks 1-4 and the Gradio UI do not depend on it.

### 3. Run UI directly (no retraining required)
```bash
python -m src.gradio_correction_app
```

### 4. Rebuild and open analytics dashboard
```bash
python scripts/build_plotly_dashboard.py
open plots/index.html
```

### Notes for new users
- If adapter files are present in `experiments/with_defs_qwen2_5_1_5B`, UI runs with your tuned model.
- If adapter is missing, update `--adapter_path` when launching UI or keep your local adapter in the same path.
- UI runtime exports are written to:
  - `data/processed/active_learning/predictions_export.jsonl`
  - `data/processed/corrections/corrections.jsonl`
  - `data/processed/active_learning/cycle_records.jsonl`

## 📊 Key Results Snapshot

### JSON validation × temperature (validation)
Source: `experiments/qwen2_5_1_5B_masked_tuned/json_validity_f1_experiment_results.csv`
- Peak validation F1 around: **0.9064**
- Production-safe stable config: **yes + 0.1** (0 repaired)

### Final test configuration comparison
Source: `experiments/qwen2_5_1_5B_masked_tuned/final_test_comparison.csv`
- `final_test_no_0p2`: F1 **0.8837** (higher, but repaired > 0)
- `final_test_yes_0p1`: F1 **0.8825** (cleaner, repaired = 0)

### Data prep impact on test
Source: `experiments/data_prep_comparison/data_prep_test_compare.csv`
- baseline test F1: **0.8837**
- with_defs test F1: **0.9066**

### Generation mode comparison (validation)
Source: `experiments/qwen2_5_1_5B_masked_tuned/gen_mode_comparison_temp_0p0_validate_yes_format_json.csv`
- constrained generation outperforms free generation

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria & Insight

### Project 2

Success Criteria:
- Identify a decoding setup that preserves high F1 while avoiding repaired or invalid outputs.
- Show whether constrained generation is better than free generation under the same configuration.
- Demonstrate whether prompt/data preparation materially changes final extraction quality.

Insight:
- The strongest Project 2 setup is built from three combined decisions rather than a single model change: `json_validate=yes`, constrained generation, and the `with_defs` data variant.
- The most production-safe operating point is `yes + 0.1`, while the strongest Project 2 test result comes from `with_defs`, which raises test F1 to **0.9066**.
- The project shows that decoding strategy and data design are first-order levers for structured NER quality, not just post-training details.

### Project 3

Success Criteria:
- Task 1 should quantify the cost and value of constrained decoding for strict JSON outputs.
- Task 2 should identify entity-type-specific critical layers and test whether selective LoRA retains most of full-layer quality.
- Task 3 should show whether activation steering can influence entity boundaries without retraining.
- Task 4 should measure adversarial robustness and verify whether mixed adversarial training improves held-out results.
- Task 5 should benchmark quantization and concurrency, identify the memory bottleneck, and recommend a deployable SLA-safe serving profile.

Insight:
- Task 1 confirms that strict JSON generation can be guaranteed, but at a meaningful latency cost when constraints are enforced.
- Task 2 shows that layer importance is not uniform across entity types; `ORG` and `MISC` emerge earlier, while `PER` and `LOC` rely more on later layers.
- Task 3 is instruction-complete, but the observed steering effect is weak in the tested range, so the tradeoff claim is only partially supported.
- Task 4 provides the clearest robustness gain, especially for multilingual, ambiguous, and nested cases after adversarial retraining.
- Task 5 is the strongest production result: model weights dominate memory usage, and the tuned `Q4_K_M` server profile meets the `<500 ms` p95 SLA.

## 🧪 Project 3 — Detailed Task Reports

### Task 1: Constrained Decoding for Structured NER

Explanation: This task checks whether schema-aware decoding improves structured NER outputs enough to justify the added inference cost.

Objective: train a LoRA adapter that emits strict JSON with character offsets and confidence, then compare constrained vs free decoding on quality, validity, and latency.

Schema:
`{"entities":[{"type","value","start","end"}], "confidence": float}`

Implementation:
- Dataset preparation, LoRA training, constrained decoding, inference, and benchmarking are implemented in `src/tasks/task1_constrained/`.
- The constrained path uses Outlines schema enforcement on the same base generation configuration used for free decoding.

Results:
- Source: `experiments/task1_constrained/task1_benchmark.csv`, `experiments/task1_constrained/results.csv`

| Mode | Samples | Precision | Recall | F1 | Validity | Elapsed |
|------|---------|-----------|--------|----|----------|---------|
| Free | 500 | 0.5146 | 0.4486 | 0.4793 | 1.0 | 709.4 s |
| Constrained | 500 | 0.5146 | 0.4486 | 0.4793 | 1.0 | 1171.3 s |
| Free | 200 | 0.5770 | 0.5061 | 0.5393 | 1.0 | 288.1 s |
| Constrained | 200 | 0.5770 | 0.5061 | 0.5393 | 1.0 | 382.7 s |

Interpretation:
- At deterministic decoding, constrained and free runs produce the same predictions, so precision, recall, and F1 are unchanged.
- JSON validity is already `100%`, which shows the adapter learned the output format reliably.
- Constraint enforcement still adds about `65%` latency overhead, so the main value here is format safety rather than quality gain.

---

### Task 2: Layer-wise Entity Type Importance

Explanation: This task analyzes which transformer layers matter most for different entity types and whether those insights can reduce LoRA training cost.

Objective: identify which transformer layers matter most for each entity type and test whether selective LoRA can preserve most of the full-model performance.

Entity types analyzed:
`PER`, `ORG`, `LOC`, `MISC`

Implementation:
- Logit-lens, early-vs-late analysis, per-layer ablation, critical-layer extraction, and selective LoRA training are implemented in `src/tasks/task2_layer_importance/`.
- Outputs are stored in `experiments/task2_layer_importance/`.

Critical layers by entity type:
- Source: `experiments/task2_layer_importance/critical_layers.json`

| Entity Type | Critical Layers (top-5 by ablation F1 drop) |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| ALL (macro) | 11, 12, 20, 6, 22 |
| PER | 11, 12, 16, 17, 9 |
| ORG | 12, 3, 4, 6, 11 |
| LOC | 11, 8, 16, 18, 20 |
| MISC | 20, 1, 25, 4, 6 |

**Early vs Late Layer Emergence:**

Source: `experiments/task2_layer_importance/results_early_late.csv`

| Entity Type | Stronger Half | Interpretation |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| ORG | Early (0–13) | Organization features develop in lower layers |
| MISC | Early (0–13) | Miscellaneous entity signals emerge early |
| LOC | Late (14–27) | Location recognition relies on higher-level representations |
| PER | Late (14–27) | Person name detection peaks in upper layers |

Selective vs full LoRA:
- Source: `experiments/task2_layer_importance/results_selective.csv`

| Adapter | Precision | Recall | F1 | Validity | Layers Trained |
|---------|-----------|--------|----|----------|----------------|
| Full (all 28 layers) | 0.3952 | 0.3791 | 0.3870 | 1.0 | 28 |
| Selective (critical only) | 0.3690 | 0.3511 | 0.3598 | 1.0 | 14 |

Interpretation:
- Layers `11` and `12` are repeatedly important across entity types and dominate the macro-critical set.
- ORG and MISC signals emerge earlier, while PER and LOC depend more on later layers.
- Selective LoRA keeps about `93%` of the full-adapter F1 while training only half the layers, which supports the efficiency claim even though full-layer training remains stronger.

---

### Task 3: Boundary Steering via Activation Intervention

Explanation: This task tests whether entity-boundary behavior can be adjusted at inference time by steering internal activations instead of retraining the model.

Objective: test whether activation steering can push generation toward stricter entity boundaries without retraining.

Setup:
- Activations extracted for `300` examples with precise vs loose boundaries.
- Steering applied at scales `0.5`, `1.0`, and `1.5` on layers `12-16`.

Model choice:
- This task uses `google/gemma-2-2b`, not the Qwen model from Tasks 1, 2, 4, and 5.
- The intent is to probe whether boundary-control signals exist in activation space even without task-specific fine-tuning.

Implementation:
- Boundary set preparation, activation extraction, steering vector computation, steered inference, and boundary evaluation are implemented in `src/tasks/task3_steering/`.
- Source: `experiments/task3_steering/results.csv`

| Layer | Scale | Precision | Recall | Boundary F1 |
|-------|-------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 12 | 0.5 | 0.00351 | 0.00491 | 0.00409 |
| 12 | 1.0 | 0.00348 | 0.00491 | 0.00408 |
| 12 | 1.5 | 0.00348 | 0.00491 | 0.00408 |
| **13** | **0.5** | **0.00350** | **0.00491** | **0.00409** |
| **13** | **1.0** | **0.00355** | **0.00491** | **0.00412** |
| **13** | **1.5** | **0.00357** | **0.00491** | **0.00413** |
| 14 | 0.5 | 0.00350 | 0.00491 | 0.00409 |
| 14 | 1.0 | 0.00350 | 0.00491 | 0.00409 |
| 14 | 1.5 | 0.00350 | 0.00491 | 0.00409 |
| 15 | 0.5 | 0.00347 | 0.00491 | 0.00407 |
| 15 | 1.0 | 0.00351 | 0.00491 | 0.00410 |
| 15 | 1.5 | 0.00348 | 0.00491 | 0.00407 |
| 16 | 0.5 | 0.00347 | 0.00491 | 0.00407 |
| 16 | 1.0 | 0.00348 | 0.00491 | 0.00407 |
| 16 | 1.5 | 0.00348 | 0.00491 | 0.00408 |

Interpretation:
- Best configuration: layer `13`, scale `1.5`, boundary F1 `0.00413`.
- Recall is effectively constant across runs, so steering mostly affects precision rather than detection coverage.
- The effect exists but is weak, mainly because the base Gemma model is not tuned for this NER JSON task.
- This completes the task instruction-wise, but the tradeoff evidence remains partial within the tested `0.5–1.5` range.

---

### Task 4: Adversarial Robustness

Explanation: This task evaluates how the extractor behaves under noisy or misleading inputs and whether adversarial fine-tuning improves reliability.

Objective: evaluate how the model behaves under adversarial entity perturbations and measure whether mixed adversarial training improves robustness.

Evaluation design:
- `100` original + `100` adversarial examples for pre-training analysis.
- Held-out adversarial comparison after `2` epochs of mixed retraining.

Implementation:
- Adversarial dataset generation, training, evaluation, and result comparison are implemented in `src/tasks/task4_adversarial/`.
- Categories include nested entities, abbreviations, misspellings, ambiguous boundaries, and multilingual noise.
- Sources: `experiments/task4_adversarial/results_pre.csv`, `results_post.csv`, `robustness_gains.csv`

| Category | Pre F1 | Post F1 | F1 Gain | Pre Boundary F1 | Post Boundary F1 | Boundary F1 Gain |
|----------|--------|---------|---------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Nested | 0.0889 | 0.3333 | **+0.2444** | 0.0889 | 0.3969 | +0.3079 |
| Abbrev | 0.2462 | 0.3235 | **+0.0774** | 0.2769 | 0.4412 | +0.1643 |
| Misspell | 0.3333 | 0.4359 | **+0.1026** | 0.3333 | 0.5897 | +0.2564 |
| Ambiguous | 0.1235 | 0.4048 | **+0.2813** | 0.1235 | 0.4048 | +0.2813 |
| Multilingual | 0.0992 | 0.6486 | **+0.5495** | 0.1322 | 0.6757 | +0.5434 |
| Original | 0.2916 | 0.5052 | +0.2136 | 0.3274 | 0.5103 | +0.1829 |
| All | 0.2267 | 0.4597 | +0.2329 | 0.2506 | 0.4988 | +0.2482 |
| Adversarial (all) | 0.1700 | 0.4186 | **+0.2486** | 0.1834 | 0.4884 | +0.3049 |

Interpretation:
- Multilingual, ambiguous, and nested examples improved the most after adversarial training.
- Overall adversarial F1 improved by about `+0.2486`, while JSON validity remained `100%`.
- Boundary F1 is consistently higher than full entity F1, which indicates boundary recovery is easier than full type+value+offset matching.

---

### Task 5: Production Profiling & Quantization

Explanation: This task converts the model from an experimental system into a deployment-oriented service by measuring memory, quality, latency, and concurrency tradeoffs.

Objective: quantify the tradeoff between model size, latency, quality, and concurrency, then produce a deployable configuration that satisfies a strict latency target.

Scope:
- Memory profiling with HuggingFace/PyTorch tooling.
- Quantized inference with `llama.cpp`.
- Full-test-set benchmarking on CoNLL2003 plus concurrency and SLA analysis.

Implementation:
- Memory profiling, quantized benchmarking, and concurrency testing are implemented in `src/tasks/task5_production/`.
- The evaluation combines HuggingFace profiling with `llama.cpp` GGUF inference.

Memory profile:
- Source: `experiments/task5_production/memory_profile.csv`, `experiments/task5_production/memory_profile.json`

| Component | Memory |
|-----------|--------|
| Model parameters (FP16) | **2944.4 MB** (3,087,428,608 bytes) |
| Activation memory per layer (mean) | **0.33 MB** (346,460 bytes) |
| Activation total (27 layers) | **~8.9 MB** |

Conclusion: the dominant bottleneck is model weights, not activation memory.

Quantization benchmark:
- Source: `experiments/task5_production/quant_benchmark_with_memory.csv`

| Quantization | File Size | Per-sample Latency | Precision | Recall | F1 | Validity |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|--------|----|----------|
| Q4\_K\_M | 940 MB | 1922.7 ms | 0.3665 | 0.3484 | 0.3573 | 1.0 |
| Q5\_K\_M | 1073 MB | 2646.7 ms | 0.4201 | 0.4040 | 0.4119 | 1.0 |
| Q8\_0 | 1570 MB | 2108.3 ms | 0.4565 | 0.4391 | 0.4476 | 1.0 |

Quality-size tradeoff: Q8\_0 gives the best F1, Q4\_K\_M gives the smallest footprint, and Q5\_K\_M sits in the middle but is the slowest in this setup.

Concurrency scaling:
- Source: `experiments/task5_production/concurrency.csv`

| Concurrency | p50 (ms) | p95 (ms) | p99 (ms) | Throughput (req/s) |
|-------------|----------|----------|----------|--------------------|
| 1 | 566.8 | 579.9 | 632.7 | 1.76 |
| 4 | 575.0 | 613.2 | 619.7 | 6.88 |
| 8 | 633.1 | 642.1 | 645.0 | 12.62 |
| 16 | 708.8 | 752.5 | 1198.0 | 21.65 |

Observation: throughput improves with concurrency, but tail latency degrades sharply at higher concurrency, especially at `16`.

SLA-tuned server runs:

| Config | Concurrency | p50 (ms) | p95 (ms) | Throughput (req/s) |
|--------|-------------|----------|----------|--------------------|
| Q4\_K\_M tuned | 1 | 268.0 | **283.7** | 3.96 |
| Q4\_K\_M tuned | 2 | 372.6 | **427.0** | 5.65 |
| Q5\_K\_M tuned | 1 | 348.6 | 363.7 | 3.05 |
| Q5\_K\_M tuned | 2 | 525.8 | 583.9 | 4.01 |
| Q8\_0 server | 1 | 634.3 | 662.4 | 1.83 |

Production recommendations:
- Source: `experiments/task5_production/production_recommendation.md`

| Profile | Quantization | Batch Size | Concurrency | p95 Latency | Throughput | F1 |
|---------|-------------|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|----|
| **Quality-first** | Q8\_0 | 1 | 1 | 662.4 ms | 1.83 req/s | 0.4476 |
| **SLA-first** (< 500ms p95) | Q4\_K\_M | 1 | 2 | **427.0 ms** | 5.65 req/s | 0.3573 |

Interpretation:
- The `<500 ms` p95 SLA is met with the tuned `Q4_K_M` server configuration.
- `Q8_0` is the best quality option but does not satisfy the same SLA in the tested setup.
- The most effective latency improvement came from reducing `max_tokens` and using low-concurrency server-style inference.

## 🧪 Experiments

This section groups the reproducible Project 2 experiment runs used to compare decoding settings, output formats, generation modes, and data-preparation variants. Each command writes structured CSV outputs under `experiments/` so the reported conclusions can be traced back to exact runs.

### 1. Parameters Experiment (JSON Validate + Temperature)
Purpose: compare `json_validate` (`yes/no`) across temperatures `0.0`, `0.1`, `0.2`.

Analysis:
- This experiment identifies the most stable decoding setup for structured JSON extraction.
- In the current runs, validation F1 peaks around `0.9064`, and the most production-safe setting is `json_validate=yes` with `temperature=0.1` because it preserves strong F1 while avoiding repaired outputs.

```bash
bash scripts/run_json_validity_f1_experiments.sh
```

Primary output:
- `experiments/qwen2_5_1_5B_masked_tuned/json_validity_f1_experiment_results.csv`

### 2. Architecture Experiment: Output Format (JSON vs XML vs plain)
Purpose: compare output format behavior under one fixed decoding setup.
Recommended fixed setup: `--temperature 0.0 --json_validate yes`

Analysis:
- This experiment checks whether schema-friendly output formats help extraction quality and post-processing reliability.
- The main use here is architectural comparison: JSON is the intended production target because it aligns with downstream parsing and evaluation, while XML/plain are reference baselines.

```bash
bash scripts/run_format_comparison_and_csv.sh \
  --temperature 0.0 \
  --json_validate yes
```

Primary output:
- `experiments/qwen2_5_1_5B_masked_tuned/fmt_format_comparison_temp_0p0_validate_yes.csv`

### 3. Architecture Experiment: Generation Mode (Constrained vs Free)
Purpose: compare decoding strategy while keeping format/config fixed.
Recommended fixed setup: `--temperature 0.0 --json_validate yes --output_format json`

Analysis:
- This experiment measures whether constrained generation improves structured extraction quality over free decoding.
- In the validation comparison, constrained generation outperforms free generation, which supports the use of constrained decoding in the final setup.

```bash
bash scripts/run_generation_mode_comparison_and_csv.sh \
  --temperature 0.0 \
  --json_validate yes \
  --output_format json
```

Primary output:
- `experiments/qwen2_5_1_5B_masked_tuned/gen_mode_comparison_temp_0p0_validate_yes_format_json.csv`

### 4. Data Prep Experiment (with_defs vs no_defs vs syn_aug)
Purpose: compare prompt/data variants after short retraining + evaluation.

Analysis:
- This experiment tests whether changing prompt context and training data structure improves final NER extraction quality.
- The strongest result comes from `with_defs`, which lifts test F1 from the baseline `0.8837` to `0.9066`, showing that adding type definitions materially improves extraction performance.

```bash
bash scripts/run_data_prep_comparison_and_csv.sh \
  --epochs 2 \
  --generation_mode constrained \
  --temperature 0.0 \
  --json_validate yes
```

Primary outputs:
- `experiments/data_prep_comparison/data_prep_comparison_temp_0p0_mode_constrained.csv`
- `experiments/data_prep_comparison/data_prep_test_compare.csv`

### Suggested Order (for reproducible reporting)
1. `run_json_validity_f1_experiments.sh`
2. `run_format_comparison_and_csv.sh`
3. `run_generation_mode_comparison_and_csv.sh`
4. `run_data_prep_comparison_and_csv.sh`

## 🧰 Project 3 Task 5 Reproducibility Notes (llama.cpp + LFS)

### Why `llama.cpp`
`llama.cpp` is used in Task 5 to convert/quantize GGUF models and run low-level quantized inference benchmarks.

### Install/build `llama.cpp` (for new users)
If `cmake` is missing (`command not found: cmake`), install it first:
```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install cmake
cmake --version
```

For Linux, install `cmake` from your package manager before building.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp.git
cd llama.cpp
cmake -S . -B build -DGGML_METAL=ON
cmake --build build -j
```

### Git LFS setup (for model artifacts)
```bash
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```

Maintainer note:
- `.gitattributes` in this repo already tracks the required large model artifacts.
- New users only need `git lfs install` and `git lfs pull`; they do not need to run `git lfs track`.

## 🎯 Recommended Production Config

Use this for stable deployment:
- model/adaptor: `experiments/with_defs_qwen2_5_1_5B`
- json_validate: `yes`
- temperature: `0.1`
- output format: `json`
- generation mode: `constrained`

---

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Add per-sample scoring in UI (when ground truth provided)
- Add model switcher in Gradio (baseline vs with_defs)
- Add review-queue prioritization by uncertainty
- Add hosted demo deployment pipeline
